# Laravel Exercise
Using Laravel, build a basic dashboard to show the current bitcoin price in USD. I'd also like to see the percent change over 1 hour, 1 day and 7 days with a graphic to note which direction the change was in.

As a member of the site, when I log in I should be given the option to change the currency to EUR and AUD. I would also like to see the percent change since I last logged in.
